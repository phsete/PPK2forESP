# PPK2 for ESP
Toolkit to measure power consumption and log events of ESP32 devices with Nordic Semiconductors PPK2.

## Usage
### Integrate a new Device that should be measured
1. Connect a Power Profiler Kit II and a ESP32-Dev-Board to any computing device able to execute Python scripts.
2. Conenct the Power Profiler Kit II to the power measurement pins of the Dev-Board.
3. Execute the node.py script on the computing device.

### Configuration
1. Make sure a valid GitHub Repository and Personal Access Token is entered in the config.toml file. This Token must allow access to the releases of the ESP-Firmware.
> An example Repository with a valid GitHub Action for creating the needed releases can be found under [https://github.com/phsete/ESPNOWLogger](https://github.com/phsete/ESPNOWLogger).
2. Configure the nodes.save file for every node that should be measured.
    * Every line represents a single node.
    * Syntax per line: `(UUID_OF_NODE[string],NODE_NAME[string],NODE_IP[string],CONNECTED_TO_PI[boolean],RELEASE_VERSION[string],TYPE[sender|receiver],PROTOCOL[string],SLEEP_MODE[string],POWER_SAVE_MODE[string])`
    * Example: `(d46c204b-b90a-4ef8-9b28-5a8f67021fef,Sensor,127.0.0.1,True,v0.2.8-f7c4323,sender,ESP_NOW,NO_SLEEP,EXAMPLE_POWER_SAVE_NONE)`
    > A example of this configuration is given with the `nodes_example.save` file.

### Start Test
1. Execute the `cli.py` script on any available device. If you need help with the syntax, simply call `cli.py --help` or `cli.py run --help`.

### View Results
1. Configure the options on the top of the viewer script.
2. Execute the `viewer.py` script and make sure that the result files are in the same folder.
3. Select a result group by entering the number stated in the output.
4. The detailled power consumption of each cycle is printed in the log.
5. A browser should open with an interactive graph of the results.
> Hint: You can save a picture of the currently shown graph by clicking on the camera at the top right of the browser view.

## Known Bugs
* _(currently not used)_ NTP request fails sometimes with:
```ntplib.NTPException: No response received from europe.pool.ntp.org```
* sometimes not every event of the ESP32 is logged
* longer runs lead to a crash of the script running out of memory
